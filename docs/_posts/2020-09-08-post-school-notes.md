The educational material from some of the schools/workshops that I've attended during 2019-2020 can be found via this page.

## 1. GROWTH Astronomy School 2020

The Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) school was designed to offer a comprehensive training to graduate and advanced undergraduate students in observational techniques and tools for follow up of transient events at X-ray, UV, optical, infrared and radio wavelengths. The school sessions are organized by wavelength range and the format includes a short lecture that introduces the topic followed by an interactive workshop where students will be engaged in data analysis using real data from the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, Palomar Observatory in California, the VLA in New Mexico and telescopes in the GROWTH global network of observatories.

## 2. Multi-Messenger Astrophysics School Asiago 2020

The past four years were marked by huge advancements in this field, with countless invaluable results such as the detection of first gravitational waves, also in correspondence with photons, as well as the simultaneous observation of photons with a 300 TeV neutrino from an active galaxy. The foundation of high energy astroparticle physics are shaken and new theoretical buildings are raised. This calls for additional focused experimental efforts, with careful planning of multi-wavelength and multi-experiments coordinated observation, especially when pointing telescopes with limited field of view are involved.

## 3. First Light School 2019: Stars, Galaxies, and Black Holes in the Epoch of Reionization

This was a school to introduce the future generation of young astronomers to the forefront of the theoretical and observational developments of the astrophysics of the epoch of re-ionisation (EoR) including the following topics all taught by international experts: the first stars, the first galaxies, the first black holes, gravitational lensing, the development of structure, observation techniques for early universe etc.
