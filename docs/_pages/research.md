## The Nature of Emission Properties and Correlations in Type 1 AGNs

My research interest includes the observational study of the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and their host galaxies. The central engine of AGNs is powered by the accretion of matter (in the form of the accretion disk) into the supermassive black hole. The produced energy is then released as radiation, winds, and/or jets. The primary focus of this work is to investigate the origin, physical processes, and evolution of these objects.

My previous works include the study of type 1 AGNs by using SDSS spectra and combined with multiwavelength catalogs (ROSAT, GALEX, 2MASS, FIRST, etc.). Some of these objects are then observed further with MRES echelle spectrograph in TNO 2.4 m telescope (Thailand). By utilizing these rich datasets, we can explore type 1 AGNs population statistical properties and understand the physics behind emission lines (i.e. the Baldwin effect and eigenvector 1 correlation). We can also investigate the feedback mechanism by radiation and jets, and examined the physical trends (e.g. mass, accretion rate, metallicity, orientation, ionization parameter, etc.) in the proposed "H-R diagram" for type 1 AGN. More information can be found in our [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/asna.202013697).

As part of my research, I've also been involved in the LOFAR radio survey project. The aim of this study is to characterize radio AGNs by using the brand new observations from LOFAR. By constructing the radio AGNs luminosity function, we can study the different modes of the black hole accretion out to unprecedented distances, providing critical constraints on the models of black hole formation and AGNs unification theories. The result is presented in this [paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1231/1/012005).

## Probing the Nature of High Redshift Weak Emission Line Quasars

So far, the currently known number of quasars beyond redshift 6.5 is very small. To find these early quasars is therefore paramount for progress in this field. Last year, we dove directly into selecting the quasar candidates using unexplored data from the Pan-STARRS and unWISE. Statistical methods were applied to generate well-vetted list of candidates and infer their purity. Some of them have been spectroscopically followed up with 6.5m--Magellan/FIRE and 8.1m--Gemini/GNIRS.

This led us to the discovery of a new quasar at redshift = 6.34 which shows very weak emission lines. HST imaging follow-up sets strong constraint on the gravitational lens-boosting, showing no apparent effect on the emission. Sub-millimeter observations with ALMA show that the quasar's host galaxy has extreme star formation rate, similar to that of hyper-luminous infrared galaxy. The inferred quasar lifetime measured from the proximity zone size suggests that this object belongs to an unexpected population of very young quasars, indicating lifetimes of only ~10,000 years, which poses significant challenges on the current black hole formation models.
