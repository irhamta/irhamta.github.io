## Setup the main theme

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
My website make use of a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)-based remote theme named [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/).
In this tutorial, I assume that you already have GitHub account, are familiar with Git, and want to create a GitHub page. 


{: style="text-align: justify;"}
The simplest way to install the theme is by copying all the [files](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) into your project, or just fork the repository and rename it to USERNAME.github.io (replace USERNAME with your GitHub username).
Then, remove the following folders and files:
* .editorconfig
* .gitattributes
* .github
* docs/
* test/
* CHANGELOG.md
* README.md
* screenshot-layouts.png
* screenshot.png

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
After that, edit your `_config.yml` file accordingly. 
The settings should be self-explanatory. 
Use my configuration file like this [one](https://github.com/irhamta/irhamta.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml) for reference.
For a full explanation of every setting be sure to read this [Configuration](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) page.

## Create the content

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
Before making the content, youâ€™ll need to create and edit the `data/navigation.yml` to set your website navigation header. Check my [navigation](https://github.com/irhamta/irhamta.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml) file as an example.

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
To make the website content, create the `_pages` and `_posts` folder in your directory.
You can then create some Markdown files to make the pages and posts.
See my [pages](https://github.com/irhamta/irhamta.github.io/tree/master/_pages) as references.
