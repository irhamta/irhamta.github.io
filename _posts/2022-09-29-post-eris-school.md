## Learning Radio Astronomy

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
The European Radio Interferometry School 2022 is a one-week workshop on radio astronomy data acquisition, reduction, and analysis.
This event is sponsored by [OPTICON-RadioNET Pilot](https://www.orp-h2020.eu/) and is hosted by Joint Institute for VLBI ERIC ([JIVE](https://jive.eu/)) as well as Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy ([ASTRON](https://www.astron.nl/)).

The materials covered by the lectures/tutorials includes:
1. Calibration and imaging of continuum, spectral line, and polarization data.
2. Low frequency (LOFAR domain), cm-wave (e-MERLIN domain), decimeter-wave (HI/OH domain), high frequency (ALMA/IRAM domain), and VLBI interferometry.
3. Extracting the information from astronomical data and interpreting the results
4. Choosing the most suitable array and observing plan for the proposed project.

## Tutorials
For the basic tutorials, please check the website below to get hands-on practice with data. The page will guide you in installing the  Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA), testing your installation, and downloading the tutorial data.
The instruction includes a quick 'how-to' install CASA for Linux and macOS.
A small tutorial on testing your CASA installation is included as well.

Note that for this part you will need the `Python 3.8` version installed because the `Python 3.6` version has some issues with the Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) advanced tutorial. 
The materials and instructions for the VLBI tutorials can be found on the page below.
