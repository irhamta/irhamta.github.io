## Python stuff

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
There are various reasons why Python offers a lot of advantages for astronomer ([check this out](https://www.astrobetter.com/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=python)). Some of the great modules that I found are:
1. The [astropy](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/index.html) package which contains key functionality and common tools needed for handling the FITS file, table, coordinate systems, built-in models, convenient fitting algorithms, calculations with units and much more. 
2. The [spectral-cube](https://spectral-cube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), for reading, manipulating, analyzing, and writing data cubes with two positional dimensions and one spectral dimension.
3. The [APLpy](https://aplpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (the Astronomical Plotting Library in Python), is a powerful and interactive plotting package aimed at producing publication-quality plots of astronomical imaging data.
4. The [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), a simple efficient tools for machine learning and predictive data analysis.
5. The [Lmfit](https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/), a high-level interface to non-linear optimization and curve fitting problems.
6. The [photutils](https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a module for detecting and performing photometry of astronomical sources.

## Reference management

For managing the papers that I've read, I usually use [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/), a free reference manager and an academic social network. Mendeley also allow you to sort papers by keyword, produce a bibtex file that can be used for LaTeX documents, and annotate PDFs in an easy way.
