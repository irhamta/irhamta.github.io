## Professional Experience

Hi there! I am a **Postdoctoral Fellow** at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/) and [Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics](https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/) in Garching.
My research focuses on understanding how the first black holes and galaxies assembled across cosmic time probed via distant strongly-lensed quasars.

I previously worked at the [Max Planck Institute for Astronomy](http://www.mpia.de/en) from 2018 to 2022 and was actively involved in the [Euclid Consortium](https://www.euclid-ec.org/) Primeval Universe Science Working Group. 
Together, we developed the strategy to find and characterize quasars and galaxies in the early universe.

Before coming to Germany, I worked as a **Data Scientist** at two startups. The first one is [Cermati](https://www.cermati.com/tentang-cermati), a technology startup that engages in the Indonesian financial technology area. The second one is a fast-growing tech startup with a mission to break the highly inefficient home & living industry named [Dekoruma](https://www.dekoruma.com/artikel/2650/about-us). My responsibilities include:
* Analyze data from various resources to solve problems and deliver insights about the business, the products, and the market.
* Data modeling using analytic programs, machine learning, and statistical methods.
* Recommend ways to improve the design and delivery of statistical analyses, including automated approaches.
