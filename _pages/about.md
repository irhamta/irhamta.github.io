## Professional Experience

Hi there! I am a Ph.D. student at the [Max Planck Institute for Astronomy](http://www.mpia.de/en) and actively involved in the [Euclid Consortium](https://www.euclid-ec.org/) Primeval Universe Science Working Group. 
Together, we develop the strategy to find and characterize quasars and galaxies in the early universe.

Before coming to Germany, I worked as a **Data Scientist** at two startups. The first one is [Cermati](https://www.cermati.com/tentang-cermati), a technology startup that engages in the Indonesian financial technology area. The second one is a fast-growing tech startup with a mission to break the highly inefficient home & living industry named [Dekoruma](https://www.dekoruma.com/artikel/2650/about-us). My responsibilities include:
* Analyze data from various resources to solve problems and deliver insights about the business, the products, and the market.
* Data modeling using analytic programs, machine learning, and statistical methods.
* Recommend ways to improve the design and delivery of statistical analyses, including automated approaches.
