## On the Nature of Active Galaxies: Emission Properties and Correlations

My research interest includes the observational study of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) and its host galaxy. The central engine of AGN is powered by the accretion of matter (in the form of the accretion disk) onto the supermassive black hole. The produced energy is then released as radiation, winds, and/or jets. The primary focus of this work is to investigate the origin, physical processes, and evolution of this kind of object.

My previous works include the study of Type 1 AGNs by using SDSS spectra combined with multiwavelength catalogs (ROSAT, GALEX, 2MASS, and FIRST). Some of these objects are observed further with MRES echelle spectrograph at TNO 2.4 m telescope (Thailand). Supported by these rich datasets, we can investigate Type 1 AGN population statistical properties and understand the physics behind emission lines (i.e., the Baldwin effect and the eigenvector 1 correlation). We can also investigate the feedback mechanism by radiation/jets and examine the physical trends (e.g., mass, accretion rate, metallicity, orientation, ionization parameter, etc.) in the proposed "H-R diagram" for type 1 AGNs. More information can be found in [Andika et al. (2020)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/asna.202013697).

As part of my research, I’ve been involved in the LOFAR radio survey project. This study aims to characterize radio AGNs by using brand-new observations from LOFAR. By constructing the radio AGNs luminosity function, we can study the different modes of the black hole accretion out to unprecedented distances, providing critical constraints on the models of black hole formation and AGNs unification theories. Check out [Andika et al. (2019)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1231/1/012005) for the details.

## Supermassive Black Holes and Galaxies in the Early Universe
Quasars are the most luminous non-transient sources in the universe.
Spectroscopically, they provide important insights into the intergalactic medium properties at the epoch of reionization.
They are also excellent probes for understanding the build-up of the first supermassive black holes as well as the metal enrichment of the first galaxies and their surroundings. 
Identification and detailed characterization of more quasars at this epoch will provide us with better constraints on the physical properties of the universe at the end of the transition phase from neutral to ionized hydrogen.

It is surrounded by neutral hydrogen, indicating that it is from the period called the epoch of reionization, when the universe's first light sources turned on.

In the current project, we dove directly into selecting the quasar candidates using unexplored data from the Pan-STARRS and unWISE.
Statistical methods were applied to generate a well-vetted list of candidates and infer their purity. 
Some of them have been spectroscopically followed up with 6.5m–Magellan/FIRE and 8.1m–Gemini/GNIRS. This led us to discover an intriguing new quasar at redshift = 6.34, which shows weak emission lines. 
HST imaging follow-up sets a strong constraint on the gravitational lens-boosting, showing no apparent effect on the emission. 
Sub-millimeter observations with ALMA show that the quasar’s host galaxy has an extreme star formation rate, similar to a hyper-luminous infrared galaxy. 
The inferred quasar lifetime measured from the proximity zone size suggests that this object belongs to an unexpected population of very young quasars, indicating lifetimes of only ~10,000 years, which poses significant challenges on the current black hole formation models.
