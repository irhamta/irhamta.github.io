## On the Nature of Active Galaxies: Emission Properties and Correlations

My research interest includes the observational study of **active galactic nucleus (AGN)** to understand its origin, physical processes, and evolution. 
AGN is powered by matter accretion onto **supermassive black hole (SMBH)**. 
The produced energy is usually released as radiation, winds, and jets.

My previous works incorporate the study of <u>Type 1 AGNs</u> using ***SDSS*** data combined with ***ROSAT***, ***GALEX***, ***2MASS***, and ***FIRST*** catalogs. 
Supported by these rich datasets, we can investigate AGN statistical properties and understand the physics behind emission lines -- i.e., the Baldwin effect and the Eigenvector 1 correlation. 
We can also study the feedback mechanism by radiation/jets and examine the associated physical trends -- e.g., mass, accretion rate, metallicity, orientation, ionization parameter, etc. -- in the proposed "H-R diagram" for broad-line AGNs. 
More information can be found in [Andika et al. (2020)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/asna.202013697).

## Supermassive Black Holes and Galaxies in the Early Universe
**Quasars** are the most luminous non-transient sources in the universe.
At high-redshifts (*z* > 6), they can have billion-solar-mass black holes as early as < 1 Gyr after the Big Bang. 
Hence, quasars are excellent probes for understanding the build-up of the first SMBHs and their host galaxies, the early structure formation, and the nature of cosmic reionization.

We currently dove directly into selecting the quasar candidates using data from ***Pan-STARRS***, ***UKIRT***, and ***unWISE***.
Statistical methods are applied to generate a well-vetted list of candidates and infer their purity. 
Some have been followed-up with ***Magellan/FIRE***, ***Gemini/GNIRS***, and ***VLT/MUSE***, which led us to discover <u>PSO J083+11</u>, an intriguing weak-line quasar at *z* = 6.34. 
***HST/WFC3-ACS*** imaging shows no gravitational lensing affecting the apparent emission.
Submillimeter observations with ***ALMA*** reveal that the quasar host has an extreme star formation rate. 
The age measured from the proximity zone size suggests that this source belongs to the young quasar population with a lifetime of only ~10,000 yr, which poses significant challenges to the current black hole formation models.
For details, please have a look at our papers ([Andika et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...903...34A/abstract), [2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220401245T/abstract)).

## Searching for Lensed Quasars through Deep Learning
Another notable issue in the *z* > 6 quasar surveys is the scarcity of **gravitationally lensed quasars**.
For decades, it has been predicted that up to a third of high-*z* quasars should be strongly lensed.
However, only one found so far (i.e., <u>J0439+1634</u> at *z* = 6.51).
A re-examination of previous selection techniques indicates a substantial bias against lensed quasars.

| *Example of negatives (galaxies and point sources) and positives (mock lenses) in the training dataset.*|

**Convolutional neural network (CNN)** has shown to be effective in pattern recognitions.
Subsequently, we exploit CNN and multiband images from ***DES***, ***VHS***, and ***unWISE*** to search for **galaxy-scale strong lenses**.
The training datasets are constructed by painting simulated lensed arcs over actual galaxy images to generate realistic **galaxy-quasar lens** models.
As a result, we present new lensed quasar candidates waiting for spectroscopic confirmation (Andika et al., in preparation).

## Cosmic Evolution of Radio Active Galactic Nuclei

A few years ago, I participated in ***LOFAR*** radio survey project. 
My research aims to characterize <u>radio AGNs</u> using brand-new observations in the low-frequency region of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
By constructing the radio AGNs luminosity function, we can study the different modes of the black hole accretion out to unprecedented distances, providing critical constraints on the models of **black hole formation** and **AGNs unification** theories.
